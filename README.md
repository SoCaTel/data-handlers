#### Directory for the Data Handlers component of SoCaTel platform.

This repository houses two components. The `handlercontroller` controls the run schedules of the `twitterhandler` 
component. The latter will query twitter accounts and store tweets at a daily basis on a specified Elasticsearch 
instance/cluster for further semantic processing.   

To avoid over-cluttering this README file, please visit the components in their respective folders with the order 
discussed above for deployment. README files within each will guide you through the process of doing so for each.
